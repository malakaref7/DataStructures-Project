It’s required to implement typical phone book management application which encompasses
searching, inserting and deleting operations. It’s required to implement this application using the
following types of binary search trees: AVL trees, 2-4 trees and heap. The initial contact list is
provided to you as a csv file. The file will include 100 contacts. Each one is located in one line and has
the following data: name (first name, last name), phone, email and address. The program accepts this
file and insert the contacts to the selected data structure. You will enable user to select between AVL
